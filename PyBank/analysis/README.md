The aim of the assignment is creating python script to analyze a given financial records. The python script need to analyze the record to calculate the required summary report. The analysis expected to generate the following result.
        1.	The total number of months included in the dataset
        2.	The net total amount of “Profit/Loses” over the entire period
        3.	The changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
        4.	Greatest increase in profit (date and amount) over the entire period
        5.	Greatest decrease in profit (date and amount)over the entire period
The assignment gives a chance to demonstrate class learnt skill of importing required modules, read and write files in text and csv formats, to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; to iterate through basic data structures; routine debugging.
In addition, interaction with github/ gitlab; clone repository in local machine, apply git commands using git bush terminal is also part of the exercise.
The final python script need to generate following result both in text file format as well as in the terminal while running the code.
