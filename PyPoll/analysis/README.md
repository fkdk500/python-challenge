The assignment gives a chance to demonstrate class learnt skill of importing required modules, read and write files in text and csv formats, to store contents in variables, lists, and dictionaries; to iterate through basic data structures; routine debugging.
In addition, interaction with github/ gitlab; clone repository in local machine, apply git commands using git bush terminal is also part of the exercise.
The final python script need to generate following result both in text file format as well as in the terminal while running the code.
